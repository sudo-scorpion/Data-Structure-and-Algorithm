## Data Structure and Algorithm Made Easy In Python

A **data structure** is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. 

This is a collection of abstract **data structures** and **algorithms** implemented in Python. The code is well commented to allow an easy comprehension. Every data structure is well tested.
